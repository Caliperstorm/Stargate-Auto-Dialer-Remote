This script is designed to automatically dial the Stargate when an address is selected from a list on a pocket computer (the "remote").
It requires the remote script to run on an advanced wireless pocket computer, and a server script to run on any computer connected to the Stargate with an interface, and with a wireless modem.

Installation:
on the advanced wireless pocket computer, run: 
wget https://github.com/Caliperstorm/Stargate-Auto-Dialer-Remote/raw/main/startupRemote.lua
wget https://github.com/Caliperstorm/Stargate-Auto-Dialer-Remote/raw/main/remote.lua

on the interface computer, run:
wget https://github.com/Caliperstorm/Stargate-Auto-Dialer-Remote/raw/main/server.lua

then run startupRemote and server on the respective computers
